## 🚀 **DevOps Engineer Questions (1-15)**

### **CI/CD & Automation**

**Q1: Walk me through your CI/CD pipeline for CloudMart.**
**A:** *"Our GitOps pipeline triggers on pull requests: Semgrep security scanning, Trivy container scanning, unit tests, and Terraform validation. On merge to main: build multi-stage Docker images, push to ECR, deploy to staging with automated E2E tests, then blue-green production deployment. Automated rollback on health check failures. Average deployment time: 8 minutes with zero downtime."*

**Q2: How do you handle secrets in your CI/CD pipeline?**
**A:** *"Kubernetes secrets for runtime, AWS Secrets Manager for external integrations, never in code or environment variables. CI/CD uses OIDC with short-lived tokens, secrets are injected at runtime, and we implement automated rotation. All secret access is audited and follows least-privilege principles."*

**Q3: Describe your Infrastructure as Code approach.**
**A:** *"Terraform with modular design - separate modules for EKS, DynamoDB, Lambda, and monitoring. State stored in S3 with DynamoDB locking, workspaces for environment separation. All changes via pull requests with automated validation using Terratest. This enabled us to provision entire environments in 15 minutes consistently."*

**Q4: How do you ensure code quality in your deployments?**
**A:** *"Multi-stage validation: pre-commit hooks, SonarCloud for code quality, security scanning with Semgrep, dependency vulnerability checks, unit tests with 80% coverage requirement, integration tests in staging, and E2E tests before production. Quality gates prevent deployment of failing builds."*

**Q5: Explain your container strategy and optimization.**

**A:** *"Proper resource requests/limits based on profiling, HPA for auto-scaling, VPA for right-sizing recommendations, cluster autoscaling for node management. We achieved 40% better resource utilization through proper sizing and eliminated resource contention."*

**Q12: Describe your approach to container security.**
**A:** *"Distroless base images, vulnerability scanning with Trivy, runtime security with Falco, non-root containers with security contexts, network policies for micro-segmentation, and image signing. We maintain zero critical vulnerabilities in production."*

**Q13: How do you handle persistent storage in Kubernetes?**
**A:** *"EBS CSI driver for persistent volumes, proper storage classes for different workloads, backup strategies for stateful applications, and monitoring for storage utilization. We implemented this for our monitoring stack requiring production-grade persistence."*

**Q14: Explain your service mesh or networking strategy.**
**A:** *"Kubernetes native networking with proper service discovery, ingress controllers for external traffic, network policies for security, and load balancing strategies. We use ALB for external traffic with path-based routing and implement proper health checks."*

**Q15: How do you handle multi-environment deployments?**
**A:** *"Separate clusters for dev/staging/production, environment-specific configurations through Helm, automated promotion pipelines, and proper environment isolation. Infrastructure as Code ensures environment consistency and reduces configuration drift."*
