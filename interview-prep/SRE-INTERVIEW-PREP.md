## ðŸŽ¯ **30 SRE Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Incident Response & Troubleshooting (Questions 1-8)**

**1. Q: Your CloudMart application is experiencing 50% error rate. Walk me through your troubleshooting approach.**

**A:** *"I follow the RED method - Rate, Errors, Duration. First, I check Grafana dashboards for error spike timing, then examine pod logs with `kubectl logs -f deployment/cloudmart-backend --tail=100`. I verify DynamoDB throttling metrics, check ELB target health, and correlate with recent deployments. If it's a DynamoDB issue, I scale read/write capacity. For pod issues, I check resource limits and restart if needed."*

**2. Q: How do you handle a DynamoDB throttling scenario in production?**

**A:** *"Immediate: Enable auto-scaling if not already active, temporarily increase provisioned capacity. Short-term: Implement exponential backoff in application code, add DLQ for failed requests. Long-term: Analyze access patterns, implement caching with ElastiCache, optimize queries, consider partition key distribution."*

**3. Q: Your Prometheus is showing high memory usage. How do you investigate and resolve?**

**A:** *"Check retention settings (`--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d`), review cardinality with `prometheus_tsdb_symbol_table_size_bytes`, identify high-cardinality metrics. Solutions: reduce retention period, implement recording rules for complex queries, scale Prometheus horizontally, or implement federation."*

**4. Q: How do you troubleshoot pod startup failures in EKS?**
